## Tic-Tac-Toe

This repo contains a tic tac toe game I developed in python3.
#
engine.py contains the python script to play tic tac toe in a variety of ways. The following players are available:
- human
- random
- ai that searches for winning moves
- ai that searches for winning moves and defends against opponent winning moves
- perfect ai (minimax algo) that cannot lose
#
skeleton.py contains my thought process of how I went about developing this game step by step
